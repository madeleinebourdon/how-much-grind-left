    <h1>How much grind left?</h1>

    <h2>What is this website?</h2>
    <p>I made this tool to help me count <strong>how many matches I have left until <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/play-online/">Pok√©mon
                TCGO</a>'s ladder resets and its prizes changes</strong>.</p>

    <p>Since a ladder lasts 3 weeks, reaching its end in time is possible, but sometimes planning helps getting the job
        done, especially if you don't have much free time. At first I used a Google Sheet that did something similar,
        but I soon realized it also had limits.</p>

    <p>Now that I'm studying web developement, I decided to make it a website and share it with the world!</p>
