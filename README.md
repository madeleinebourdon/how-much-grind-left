# How much grind left?

A website to help you count how many wins you need to get to the end of the ladder and help you planning your time, so that you may never miss the top prize again!

## WIP
1. better database filters to weed out (for example) unneeded information, like earned coins, which stays the same for every ladder
2. making a Twitter account that will tweet whenever the ladder changes and linking it in the footer

## Planned
1. "contact" page
2. Date picker for both prize list pages

## Done
1. ~~Adding a database for every top prize, with pictures and description~~
2. ~~making another database of every ladder price ever set since this site's creation (coins, chests and boosters included)~~

## Features I'm still pondering about
1. add user accounts to get personnalized results (like an average of points earned each day) ?
2. French translation
