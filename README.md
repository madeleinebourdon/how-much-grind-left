# How much grind left?

A website to help you count how many wins you need to get to the end of the ladder and help you planning your time, so that you may never miss the top prize again!

## Features I'm thinking about
1. making a database for every top prize, with pictures and description
3. making a Twitter account that will tweet whenever the ladder changes
4. making another database of every ladder price ever set since this site's creation (coins, chests and boosters included)
7. adding French translation, since I'm French
